# Caesar-Cipher
Python implementation of the popular encryption technique, Caesar Cipher.

myfile.dat can be ignored for the intital test of Caesar.py, but will be used to print the encrypted key to once the encrypt function has completed. You can run the program again to read from the file to obtain the encrypted key, and will decrypt that same key, producing the original plaintext.
